## Problem Statement

### ML Model Marketplace
Given the recent surge in interest in AI models and LLMs, you have been tasked with building an application that showcases the various models deployed by organisations and developers alike. The application will go live as-is, so it is up you to develop an interface which is informative and enticing. The application should capture the nuances of a real-life production application, and show the various models available, their categories, and should allow end-users to select and explore any one model.
### Brownie Points
- [x] A space for creating these models.
- [x] Try it out
